            The area was at the southern end of Nubia and little is known about its ancient history and only limited
            archaeological work has been conducted in this area. It was part of the kingdom of Alodia for several
            centuries and with that state's collapse in the early sixteenth century, it became the centre of the Funj
            Sultanate.

            Katfia in Gezira was the place where the Wad Habuba Revolt took place in April 1908.

            The Gezira Scheme was a program launched in 1925 to foster cotton farming. At that time the Sennar Dam and
            numerous irrigation canals were built. Al Jazirah became the Sudan's major agricultural region with more
            than 10,000 square kilometres (2.5Ã—106 acres) under cultivation. The administrative state of Gezira was
            established on 1 July 1943, after the Blue Nile state was divided into three. The initial development
            project was semi-private, but the government nationalised it in 1950. Cotton production increased in the
            1970s but by the 1990s increased wheat production has supplanted a third of the land formerly seeded with
            cotton
