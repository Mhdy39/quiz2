            officially the Republic of the Sudan (Arabic: جمهورية السودان, romanized: Jumhūriyyat as-Sūdān), is a
            country in Northeast Africa. It borders the countries of Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Eritrea,
            Ethiopia, Libya, South Sudan, and the Red Sea. It has a population of 44.91 million people as of 2021[13]
            and occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres (728,215 square miles), making it Africa's third-largest country by
            area, and the third-largest by area in the Arab League. It was the largest country by area in Africa and the
            Arab League until the secession of South Sudan in 2011,[14] since which both titles have been held by
            Algeria. Its capital is Khartoum and its most populated city is Omdurman (part of metro Khartoum).

            During the Mamluk and Ottoman periods, slave trade played a big role and was demanded from the Sudanese
            Kashif than the regular remittance of tribute. In 1811 these Mamluks established a state at Dunqulah as a
            base for their slave trading. Under Turco-Egyptian rule of Sudan beginning in the 1820s, slave trading
            practice was entrenched along a north-south axis, with slave raids taking place in southern part of the
            country and slaves where transported to Egypt and the Ottoman empire.[15]

            Ottoman Turks controlled some of its territory for a short period of time. After Sudan became independent
            the Jaafar Nimeiry regime, began Islamist rule.[16] This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the
            seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the south.
